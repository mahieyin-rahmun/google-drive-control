# google-drive-control
This is a sandbox repository where I experiment with the Google Drive REST API to create scripts that can remotely manage folder creation/deletion/scheduled access control automatically.

Getting started:
Head over to https://developers.google.com/drive/api/v3/quickstart/python to activate Drive API and get your credentials.json.

You need to install the following libraries after that:

`pip install --upgrade google-api-python-client google-auth-httplib2 google-auth-oauthlib`

Once that's done, it is mostly about using the API ;)
